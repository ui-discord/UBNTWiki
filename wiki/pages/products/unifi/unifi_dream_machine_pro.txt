===== Getting Started =====
  * In order to install Protect on the UDM-Pro, a hard drive must be installed and the machine rebooted. 
    * WARNING: All contents of the hard drive will be deleted once the UDM-Pro is rebooted and the drive is initialized for the first time.

===== Known Issues =====
  * <del>Prior to 1.0.26 firmware, the LCM Module did not function and would continually cycle the Ubiquiti logo. Beginning with 1.0.26, the LCM is functional, albeit with limited functionality. Information displayed (as of this update) is not necessarily accurate.</del>
  * <del>WAN SFP+ port does not currently NAT traffic, you must use the RJ45 port for upstream WAN connectivity.</del>
  * <del>PPPoE & NAT issues are currently being troubleshooted by Ubiquiti staff.</del>
  * <del>Multi-WAN is not an option currently.</del>
  * <del>Restoring a backup, whether from an external controller or even the same UDM is not yet functional, as of 1.0.26 and prior.</del>
  * <del>Applying new settings to the UDM-Pro could interrupt WAN connectivity for approximately 2 seconds.</del>
  * Speed Tests run from the controller on the UDM-Pro show inflated numbers and are not reliable at this time.
===== Troubleshooting tips =====
 **Log file locations are located in the following places**
  * /var/log/messages
  * /mnt/data/log
  * Additionally the executable **oopsdump** can be run to retrieve log files.
    * You can also execute the following command to TAR all logs that might be helpful for Ubiquiti - ''tar -czvf /mnt/data/logs.tar.gz /mnt/data/log/*''

 **SSH information**
    * Username = root
    * Password = Your UI account password used when you setup the device. 
    * NOTE: Changing your UI SSO password will update for authentication to the controller, but will NOT change the device SSH credentials. This means that it will continue to be the password you used when setting up the device.
