===== UniFi Dream Machine Platform Notes =====
  * UDM appliances have built in UniFi controllers and cannot be adopted by external controllers.
  * Multiple sites are no longer supported on UDM platforms.
  * The built-in 8 port switch supports non-blocking throughput of 16 Gbps (1Gbps full duplex across all ports), but only has a 1 Gbps CPU uplink, limiting inter-VLAN routing throughput. Intra-VLAN throughput is line-rate.

===== Getting Started =====
   * Since 1.8 Protect is automatically installed and won't need hard drive to run. Without hard drive you can adopt cameras and check video feed but no recording features are available. 


===== Known Issues =====
  * <del>Prior to 1.0.26 firmware, the LCM Module did not function and would continually cycle the Ubiquiti logo. Beginning with 1.0.26, the LCM is functional, albeit with limited functionality. Information displayed (as of this update) is not necessarily accurate.</del>
  * <del>WAN SFP+ port does not currently NAT traffic, you must use the RJ45 port for upstream WAN connectivity.</del>
  * <del>PPPoE & NAT issues are currently being troubleshooted by Ubiquiti staff.</del>
  * <del>Multi-WAN is not an option currently.</del>
  * <del>Restoring a backup, whether from an external controller or even the same UDM is not yet functional, as of 1.0.26 and prior.</del>
  * <del>Applying new settings to the UDM-Pro could interrupt WAN connectivity for approximately 2 seconds.</del>
  * Speed Tests run from the controller on the UDM-Pro show inflated numbers and are not reliable at this time.
===== Troubleshooting tips =====
 **High RAM usage, or kswapd using too much CPU**
This is likely due to Java and/or Mongod using too much memory
  * You can reboot the entire UDMP , or
  * ''unifi-os restart'' which will restart the container running the controllers
  * ''unifi-os shell'' and ''etc/init.d/unifi restart'' then  to restart the controller directly.


 **Log file locations are located in the following places**
  * /var/log/messages
  * /mnt/data/log
  * Additionally the executable **oopsdump** can be run to retrieve log files.
    * You can also execute the following command to TAR all logs that might be helpful for Ubiquiti - ''tar -czvf /mnt/data/logs.tar.gz /mnt/data/log/*''

 **SSH information**
    * Username = root
    * Password = Your UI account password used when you setup the device. 
    * NOTE: Changing your UI SSO password will update for authentication to the controller, but will NOT change the device SSH credentials. This means that it will continue to be the password you used when setting up the device.
