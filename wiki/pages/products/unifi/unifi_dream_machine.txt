===== Getting Started =====

===== Known Issues =====

===== Troubleshooting tips =====
 **High RAM usage, or kswapd using too much CPU**
This is likely due to Java and/or Mongod using too much memory
  * You can reboot the entire UDMP , or
  * ''unifi-os restart'' which will restart the container running the controllers
  * ''unifi-os shell'' and ''etc/init.d/unifi restart'' then  to restart the controller directly.


 **Log file locations are located in the following places**
  * /var/log/messages
  * /mnt/data/log
  * Additionally the executable **oopsdump** can be run to retrieve log files.
    * You can also execute the following command to TAR all logs that might be helpful for Ubiquiti - ''tar -czvf /mnt/data/logs.tar.gz /mnt/data/log/*''

 **SSH information**
    * Username = root
    * Password = Your UI account password used when you setup the device. 
    * NOTE: Changing your UI SSO password will update for authentication to the controller, but will NOT change the device SSH credentials. This means that it will continue to be the password you used when setting up the device.
