===== Getting Started =====
  * When installing UDR for the first time from initial EA batch, upgrade the firmware to latest version and after that factory reset the device. This will resolve issues present in the initial version of the firmware.

===== Known Issues =====
  * Due memory limitations UDM/UDR only supports 11 IDS/IPS categories, network application shows incorrect information.
  * Integrated SSD is not shown in UDM SE settings, to check storage status you need to use ssh. 
  * LCM crashes and/or slows down when system is under heavy load.
