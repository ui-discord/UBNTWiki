===== Getting Started =====
  * UDM SE includes integrated SSD drive what enables protect to run in limited mode, meaning it will only record events. To get every Protect feature enabled, you need to use hard drive.  
  * When product was released to Early Access, it was initially called UniFi Dream Machine Pro SE (UDM-PRO-SE), it was later renamed to UniFi Dream Machine SE (UDM-SE).

===== Known Issues =====

  * Integrated SSD is not shown in UDM SE settings, to check storage status you need to use ssh.
