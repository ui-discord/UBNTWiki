**Series Type:** UniFi Dream Machine\\
**Website Link:** [[https://store.ui.com/collections/early-access/products/dream-machine-pro-se-ea|UniFi Dream Machine SE]]\\
**Model:** UDM-SE\\
**Type:** Enterprise Gateway Router with 10gb WAN & LAN, 8x 1GbE PoE ports.\\

**Description:** //The UniFi Dream Machine Special Edition is an all-in-one, enterprise-class network and security gateway that bundles 10 Gbps SFP+ and 2.5 Gbps RJ45 WAN capability, a Gigabit PoE switch, and a network video recorder with 128 GB of storage–and lets you manage it all from a single web or mobile interface.//\\

===== Features =====
  * 1.7 GHz quad-core processor
  * Ports 1-2 GbE 802.3at (PoE+), Ports 3-8 GbE 802.3af (PoE) LAN
  * 10G SFP+ LAN port
  * Dual WAN ports for redundancy: 10G SFP+ and 2.5G RJ-45
  * Quick, Bluetooth-powered setup via the UniFi Network web application or mobile app
  * Scalable UniFi Network Controller with advanced management capabilities
  * UniFi Protect video surveillance NVR with 3.5" (or 2.5") HDD support
  * Enterprise-class IPS/IDS and DPI capabilities
  * 1.3" LCM color touchscreen for at-a-glance network monitoring

===== UniFi Dream Machine Platform Notes =====
  * UDM appliances have built in UniFi controllers and cannot be adopted by external controllers.
  * Multiple sites are no longer supported on UDM platforms.
  * The built-in 8 port switch supports non-blocking throughput of 16 Gbps (1Gbps full duplex across all ports), but only has a 1 Gbps CPU uplink, limiting inter-VLAN routing throughput.  Intra-VLAN throughput is line-rate.

===== Getting Started =====
  * UDM SE includes integrated SSD drive what enables protect to run in limited mode, meaning it will only record events. To get every Protect feature enabled, you need to use hard drive.  
  * When product was released to Early Access, it was initially called UniFi Dream Machine Pro SE (UDM-PRO-SE), it was later renamed to UniFi Dream Machine SE (UDM-SE).

===== Known Issues =====

  * Integrated SSD is not shown in UDM SE settings, to check storage status you need to use ssh.
