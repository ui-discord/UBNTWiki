====== Wireless AP Comparison ======


=== Does a nanoHD provide any advantage over the U6-LR? ===
//via brwainer on Discord//

nanoHD is 802.11ac Wave 2 (WiFi 5).  U6-LR is 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6).

Also theoretically they have different antenna configurations - the "LR" name  for both Wi-Fi 5 and Wi-Fi 6 means a more sensitive reception circuit, and an antenna that is more optimized for out along the ceiling/wall, versus down/out from the AP

When comparing the UAP-AC-Lite, UAP-AC-LR, and UAP-AC-Pro (all ac Wave 1) for example, in a clear environment the LR is usable at further distances, but in any congested environment that just means the AP will be able to receive more interference, making it less useful.

===== Max Tx Power, Antenna Gain, EIRP =====

Approximate maximum EIRPs for each AP. Actual Transmit power and gain may be lower depending on your channel width, frequency, and specific hardware details. To get your AP's exact Tx power level run iwconfig in an ssh session.  Gain values are relative to a theoretical perfect omnidirectional antenna, and are subject to the radiation patterns of the antennas in the device.

US DFS Channels will result in lower maximum power settings on APs that can exceed the EIRP limit for DFS. 

US 6Ghz Low Power Indoor (LPI) operation is subject to power limits based on channel width - EIRP limits by channel width: 20Mhz 18dBM, 40Mhz 21dBm, 80Mhz 24dBm, 160Mhz 27dBm, 320Mhz 30dBm.

US 6Ghz Full Power (36dBm EIRP) or Outdoor Operation (any power level) requires AFC.
