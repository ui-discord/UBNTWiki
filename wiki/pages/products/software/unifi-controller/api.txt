Documentation of API endpoints on the UniFi controller software.  This is a reverse engineering project that is based on browser captures, jar dumps, and reviewing other software that has been written to work with the controller.  It's received minimal testing.

There are two main types of calls.  One would be the REST-like which provide get/post/put/delete where post is to the base and put/delete are often tied to the _id of the object that you are working with.  The second major type of web interface provided is an agent/call based system where you pass a command to an agent to perform an action.  Both use application/json formatting for all data transfer.  When updating a specific object you must use PUT or else a new object will be created.

**NOTE: All calls are relative to the base controller URL**

Calls return both a web status as well as JSON formatted output.  200 codes indicate a successful call and other indicate errors. I am using the placeholder `{site}` for the site name which for many installations will be `default`.

<code>
# Login required
{ "data" : [ ] , "meta" : { "msg" : "api.err.LoginRequired" , "rc" : "error"}}
# Call was a success but returned no values
{ "data" : [ ] , "meta" : { "rc" : "ok"}}
# NOTE: If meta contains a count it's because the data values have been truncated
'meta': {'count': 4818, 'rc': 'ok'} # from the api/s/{site}/stat/event endpoint
</code>

==== UDM Pro API ====

**NOTE:** There are two critical differences between Unifi controllers and the UDM Pro's API:

  * The login endpoint is **''/api/auth/login''**
  * All API endpoints need to be prefixed with **''/proxy/network''** (e.g. ''%%https://192.168.0.1/proxy/network/api/s/default/self%%'')

==== Controller Endpoints ====

These are REST calls that can be made without a site context.  I do not believe any updates ( PUT ) can be called on these endpoints.

^ Path ^ Method ^ Notes ^
| status | GET | Returns some very basic server information - This appears to be the only endpoint that can be reached without an authentication |
| <code>
{ "data" : [ ] , "meta" : { "rc" : "ok" , "server_version" : "5.7.23" , "up" : true , "uuid" : "0e727580-ffff-ffff-ffff-403dcd5a7bd4"}}
</code> |||
| api/login | POST | requires dict of username, password, and optionally remember=true for long-running sessions.  Returns 200 for success and a cooke that is your session. **NOTE:** On UDM Pros this is api/auth/login. |
| api/logout | POST | destroys the sever side session id which will make future attempts with that cookie fail |
| api/self | GET | Logged in user |
| api/self/sites | GET | Get basic information for all sites on this controller |
| api/stat/sites | GET | Same as above with an additional information on health and new alerts for each site |
| api/stat/admin | GET | List administrators and permissions for all sites |

==== Site Endpoints ====

All commands are presumed to be prefixed with ''%%api/s/{site}%%''

There are 2,213 named applications in the javascript **dynamic.dpi.js**.  See extracted [[products:software:unifi-controller:api:cat_app_json|cat_app.json]] to include for lookups and example usage.

The application id is a compound id using bitwise shift left on the category id + application id sent from the api using ''%%list_dpi_stats_filtered%%''
<code>
function compoundId($cat, $app){
  return (intval($cat) << 16) + intval($app);

==== Update of Port Forward Rules ====

This may apply to other configurations, but initial testing shows that port forward rules can be enabled/disabled using PUT against the endpoint /api/s/{site}/rest/portforward/{rule-id} with a body such as:
<code>{
    "enabled": true
}</code>

The rule ID can be retrieved using the above described port forwarding GET request and is found in the "_id" key.

New rules can be created using POST, but be aware that there seems to be very little validation (it's possible to create entries with no information other than the fact that they're enabled, for example).
