Documentation of API endpoints on the UniFi controller software.  This is a reverse engineering project that is based on browser captures, jar dumps, and reviewing other software that has been written to work with the controller.  It's received minimal testing.

There are two main types of calls.  One would be the REST-like which provide get/post/put/delete where post is to the base and put/delete are often tied to the _id of the object that you are working with.  The second major type of web interface provided is an agent/call based system where you pass a command to an agent to perform an action.  Both use application/json formatting for all data transfer.  When updating a specific object you must use PUT or else a new object will be created.

**NOTE: All calls are relative to the base controller URL**

Calls return both a web status as well as JSON formatted output.  200 codes indicate a successful call and other indicate errors. I am using the placeholder `{site}` for the site name which for many installations will be `default`.

<code>
# Login required
{ "data" : [ ] , "meta" : { "msg" : "api.err.LoginRequired" , "rc" : "error"}}
# Call was a success but returned no values
{ "data" : [ ] , "meta" : { "rc" : "ok"}}
# NOTE: If meta contains a count it's because the data values have been truncated
'meta': {'count': 4818, 'rc': 'ok'} # from the api/s/{site}/stat/event endpoint
</code>

==== UDM Pro API ====

**NOTE:** There are two critical differences between Unifi controllers and the UDM Pro's API:

  * The login endpoint is **''/api/auth/login''**
  * All API endpoints need to be prefixed with **''/proxy/network''** (e.g. ''%%https://192.168.0.1/proxy/network/api/s/default/self%%'')

=== Examples ===

<accordion collapsed="true">
 
<panel title="curl">
<code>
curl -k -X POST --data '{"username": "usr", "password": "$pw"}' -b cookie.txt https://udmp:443/proxy/network/api/auth/login
# responds with 'Not Found'
curl -k -X GET -b cookie.txt https://udmp/proxy/network/api/s/default/self
# responds with proper json
</code>
 </panel>
 <panel title="python">
<code>
import requests
from requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions import InsecureRequestWarning
requests.packages.urllib3.disable_warnings(InsecureRequestWarning)
headers = {"Accept": "application/json","Content-Type": "application/json"}
data = {'username': 'usr', 'password': 'pw'}
s = requests.Session()
r = s.post('https://udmp:443/api/auth/login', headers = headers,  json = data , verify = False, timeout = 1)
print(r.status_code)
print(s.get('https://udmp/proxy/network/api/s/default/self', headers = headers, verify = False, timeout = 1).text)

==== Controller Endpoints ====

These are REST calls that can be made without a site context.  I do not believe any updates ( PUT ) can be called on these endpoints.

==== Update of Port Forward Rules ====

This may apply to other configurations, but initial testing shows that port forward rules can be enabled/disabled using PUT against the endpoint /api/s/{site}/rest/portforward/{rule-id} with a body such as:
<code>{
    "enabled": true
}</code>

The rule ID can be retrieved using the above described port forwarding GET request and is found in the "_id" key.

New rules can be created using POST, but be aware that there seems to be very little validation (it's possible to create entries with no information other than the fact that they're enabled, for example).
