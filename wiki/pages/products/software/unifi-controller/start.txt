Sometimes older UniFi devices will be designated as [[https://help.ui.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500001268521 | obsolete/vintage]] by Ubiquiti and might not function properly in newer controller versions. The following are some community announcements related to older devices that might require staying with older controller releases.

===== Controller API =====

The controller can be accessed via an HTTP API, which can be useful when advanced functionality is needed. We have created an [[products:software:unifi-controller:api | API Documentation]] page with consolidated community knowledge about the API, since Ubiquiti doesn't provide this information themselves. There is a link to a basic shell API client that Ubiquiti does provide with each controller release. There are also several API clients that have been released by the community.
